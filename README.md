# C64-Synapsid

An attempt to create a simple SID software synthesizer. Maybe I will make less simple eventyally.
First goal is to make a software that can play one octave of chromatic notes with a keyboard.
Next would be shaping the sounds with ADSR. After then mayb emore interesting aspects of sound shaping.

Should work on CBM prg Studio.

How to:
- Checkout code
- Install CBM http://www.ajordison.co.uk/download.html
- Download Vice64 emulator
- Setup Vice64 emulator path in CBM

- Launch CBM
- Open project in CBM
- Hit Ctrl + F5, then Esc
- You can quit the app by pressing Esc + PageUp
